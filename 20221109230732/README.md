# UNIX text editors

- first there was QED (for 'quick editor') for the Berkeley Timesharing System, it released in 1967
- which later inspired **ed**, written by Ken Thompson as a core part of UNIX, released in 1973
- later there was apparently even something called **em** developed in 1975 by George Coulouris
- who allegedly presented it to Bill Joy who modified it into **ex** around 1976
- which became **vi** after being given a visual interface, the name 'vi' is a command in ex for said interface
- then there was an attempt called **Stevie** in 1987 by Tim Thompson, based on **vi** source code
- upon which **Vim** was built in 1991 by Bram Moolenaar
- and in 2015 a fork that goes by the name **Neovim** was released

## and aside from all that

- there is also **nano**
- and **emacs**
